        <p>An Arduino based controller, transmitter and receiver system for Astromech R-Series droids.</p>

<p>Requirements: Arduino IDE 1.0 is required. Digi XBee Series 2 operating API 2 mode, Pro series is optional &amp; encouraged. Series 1 &amp; 2.5 or clones are not supported, however may work with code changes.</p>

<p>Arduino Mega 2560 or better are needed for the Controller and Receiver due to variable memory requirement.</p>

<p>The design is a very modular, RF controller &amp; receiver with optional additional modules. The RSeries receiver can operate as a centralized or distributed depending on your requirements.</p>

<p>The RSeries Controller &amp; Receiver are shields that fit Arduino Mega 2560 R1 to R3, while the I2C FX Module is a Arduino Uno shield for R1 to R3 as well.</p>

<p>The SlipRing Interface, is a stand alone upto 24 Wire SlipRing interface at 2amps to pass signals, (Servo, Audio, I2C &amp; Power) between the Dome &amp; Body of the astromech via the slip ring via DB-25 connectors.</p>

<p>Some may just wish to use Controller/Receiver combination to trigger "Events" or actions in their astromech, and not actually control their droid motive systems.</p>

<p>It is possible to control other RC receivers, i.e. Spektrum &amp; Hitech Aurora, with this effort, however that is currently outside of the scope of this project.</p>

<p>Digi XBee Series 2 are required to be running in API 2 mode.</p>

<p>PCB CAM/Gerber Files are also available for Download for submission to PCB fab houses, and we highly recommend pcb.laen.org.</p>

<p>PCBs are available directly at <a href="http://store.oshpark.com/collections/droid-parts">http://store.oshpark.com/collections/droid-parts</a></p>

<p>Build time ranges from 3hrs to 6hrs with all modules.</p>

<p>Forks!
Some talented builders have reworked the RSeries code, made it their own and graciously shared their hard work with the community.</p>
