{"name":"Rseries","tagline":"Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/rseries-open-control","body":"An Arduino based controller, transmitter and receiver system for Astromech R-Series droids.\r\n\r\nRequirements: Arduino IDE 1.0 is required. Digi XBee Series 2 operating API 2 mode, Pro series is optional & encouraged. Series 1 & 2.5 or clones are not supported, however may work with code changes.\r\n\r\nArduino Mega 2560 or better are needed for the Controller and Receiver due to variable memory requirement.\r\n\r\nThe design is a very modular, RF controller & receiver with optional additional modules. The RSeries receiver can operate as a centralized or distributed depending on your requirements.\r\n\r\nThe RSeries Controller & Receiver are shields that fit Arduino Mega 2560 R1 to R3, while the I2C FX Module is a Arduino Uno shield for R1 to R3 as well.\r\n\r\nThe SlipRing Interface, is a stand alone upto 24 Wire SlipRing interface at 2amps to pass signals, (Servo, Audio, I2C & Power) between the Dome & Body of the astromech via the slip ring via DB-25 connectors.\r\n\r\nSome may just wish to use Controller/Receiver combination to trigger \"Events\" or actions in their astromech, and not actually control their droid motive systems.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to control other RC receivers, i.e. Spektrum & Hitech Aurora, with this effort, however that is currently outside of the scope of this project.\r\n\r\nDigi XBee Series 2 are required to be running in API 2 mode.\r\n\r\nPCB CAM/Gerber Files are also available for Download for submission to PCB fab houses, and we highly recommend pcb.laen.org.\r\n\r\nPCBs are available directly at [http://store.oshpark.com/collections/droid-parts](http://store.oshpark.com/collections/droid-parts)\r\n\r\nBuild time ranges from 3hrs to 6hrs with all modules.\r\n\r\nForks!\r\nSome talented builders have reworked the RSeries code, made it their own and graciously shared their hard work with the community.\r\n\r\nMicke's TUSCEN project can be found [here](http://astromech.net/forums/showthread.php?t=13496).\r\nSkwerl's fork is detailed [here](http://astromech.net/forums/showthread.php?t=16108) and the code can be found [here](https://github.com/Skwerl/rseries).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
